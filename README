Wyvern-Tail ActionScript Game Development Library

See LICENSE for terms of use.

Wyvern-Tail provides a simple Entity-Component framework and integration for
Ogmo Editor data to be used with the Starling library.  The following tools
chain is recommend for getting the most use out of Wyvern-Tail:

- FlashDevelop
- Starling Game Engine
- Ogmo Editor
- TexturePacker

There are two major components to this package,

- The library found under the lib/wyverntail directory.
- The framework found under the framework directory.

The library contains the core functionality of the Wyvern-Tail project.
Under library/core there are the classes the define the Entity-Component
architecture, as well as core types.

The library/ogmo directory contains classes specific to Wyvern-Tail's Ogmo
integration systems and are not depended on by the other library classes.
Ogmo Editor is not strictly necessary to use these classes since the data file
formats are straight-forward.

The framework demonstrates the use of the library and is meant to be forked
(copied and modified) to suit your project.  Under framework/src there is
core application code, under framework/src/ui there is a sample UI flow
system, and under framework/src/common there are useful utility classes.

This project's home is on GitHub,

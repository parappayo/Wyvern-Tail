Wyvern Tail AS3 Game Development Library

See license.txt for terms of use.

There are two major components to this package,

- The library found under the lib/wyverntail directory.
- The framework found under the framework directory.

The library is meant to be used without needing to be editted for your
specific project, although you may of course edit it if you wish.

The framework depends on the library and is meant to be copied and modified
to suit your project.  It may be also useful as merely a reference, if you
find that it does not suit your project.

This project's home is on Google Code,

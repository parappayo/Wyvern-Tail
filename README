Wyvern-Tail ActionScript Game Development Library

See LICENSE for terms of use.

Wyvern-Tail provides a simple Entity-Component framework and integration for
Ogmo Editor data to be used with the Starling library.  The following tools
chain is recommend for getting the most use out of Wyvern-Tail:

- FlashDevelop
- Starling Game Engine
- Ogmo Editor
- TexturePacker

There are two major components to this package,

- The library found under the lib/wyverntail directory.
- The framework found under the framework directory.

The library contains the core functionality of the Wyvern-Tail project.
Under library/core there are the classes the define the Entity-Component
architecture, as well as core types such as Prefab, Camera, Flow, and other
such game engine systems.

The library/ogmo directory contains classes specific to Wyvern-Tail's Ogmo
integration systems and are not depended on by any of the other library
classes.  Ogmo Editor is not strictly necessary to use these classes since
the data file formats are straight-forward.

The library/common directory provides non-essential helper classes that are
not specific to any project.  This part of the library is a work in progress
and is intended to speed up rapid prototyping with some common game design
behaviours.

The framework demonstrates the use of the library and is meant to be forked
(copied and modified) to suit your project.  Under framework/src there is
core application code, under framework/src/ui there is a sample UI flow
system, and under framework/src/common there are some sample utility classes.
